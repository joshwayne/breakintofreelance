				<p>Hi, I’m Josh Wayne. I’m a UX/Product Designer with over 16 years of experience working with everything from Fortune 500 companies, to startups, to nonprofits. I love designing and teaching. My goal is to help more designers find create freedom and flexibility in their work.</p>
				
				<p>10 years ago, I was burned out. I hated my job and I felt like I couldn’t spend another day commuting to an office. I told my boss I needed a break, bought a one way ticket, and spent 3 months backpacking on the other side of the world.</p>
				
				<p>On my flight home I made a decision: I was on a career path I didn’t want. I decided I was going to take control of my career, quit my job, and freelance full time.</p>
				
				<p>That first year I increased my income by 20%. Since then, I’ve made thousands more than old job while doing projects for companies like Google, Kaiser Permanente, DaVita, Bank of America, and more.</p>
				
				<p>Most designers don’t know how to start freelancing. They read dozens of blog posts and hear all the freelancing horror stories and still don’t feel confident they can make it freelancing.</p>
				
				<p>In this course, I’m sharing everything I’ve learned in my 9 years of freelancing. I’m sharing all the strategies, mistakes, lessons, and tactics to help other designers learn how to freelance so they can take control over their income, escape the 9 to 5, or just make a few extra bucks on the side.</p>
